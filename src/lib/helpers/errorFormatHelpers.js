/*
  Catch Errors Handler

  With async/await, you need some way to catch errors
  Instead of using try{} catch(e) {} in each controller, we wrap the function in
  catchErrors(), catch any errors they throw, and pass it along to our express middleware
  with next()

  Custom Error Handler

  This is derived from Node’s Error. It centralizes error object within the app
