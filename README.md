# backend-test project
Alpha-Next Backend test

# Scope
In this challenge, you should build a basic API for an application that provides competitor analysis. The features should include:

1. Creation of a Competitor Profile:
   - The profile should include the business name, type, and location.
   - Include metrics like website traffic (dummy data is fine).
 
2.	Viewing Competitor Details:
    - Show detailed metrics for each competitor, including website traffic and top-performing pages (dummy data is fine).

# Requirements

1.	Create the project using any technology of your preference.

2.	Although you can use as many dependencies as you want, manage them wisely.

3.	The API must be documented in some way.

# Deliverables
The project source code and dependencies should be made available on GitHub. Here are the steps you should follow:

1.	Fork this repository to your GitHub account (create an account if you don’t have one).

2.	Create a “development” branch and commit the code to it. Do not push the code to the main branch.

3.	Include a README file that describes:
    - Special build instructions, if any.
    -  List of third-party libraries used and short description of why/how they were used.
    -  link to the API documentation.

4.	Once the work is complete, create a pull request from “development” into “main” and send us the link.

5.	Avoid using huge commits hiding your progress. Feel free to work on a branch and use git rebase to adjust your commits before submitting the final version.

# Coding Standards
When working on the project, be as clean and consistent as possible.

# Project Deadline

# General
   - The application should run without errors.
   - Are all requirements set above met?
   - Is the coding style consistent?
   - Is the API well documented?

# Submission
1.	A link to the GitHub repository.
2.	Briefly describe how you decided on the tools that you used.

# Have Fun Coding
   - This challenge description is intentionally vague in some aspects, but if you need assistance, feel free to ask for help.
   - If any of this seems out of your current level, you may skip it, but remember to tell us about it in the pull request.
